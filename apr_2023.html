	(11:15 am) i turned 25 3 days ago and 3 days before that i was in nyc and i was visiting nyu for my transfer. turns out the professor that i wanted to work with is awful (one of her grad students said "she made six years of my life hell") but its fine, everything is fine. theres another professor who is doing exactly what i want to do and im going to office politics my way into her group and do what i want to do. i havent finished any books recently, ive been starting more and more and its hard to finish them. the one im most dedicated to reading right now is trans girl suicide museum. the title is from when one of the author's friends told her the five words that would describe her gender were trans girl suicide museum. its hard to read this book. its hard to read anything about gender really. the five words i would use to describe my gender currently would be eats burrata every day. this is what ive been doing recently and its probably the best thing any one can do for their long term mental health. burrata with hot bread and some sort of other thing. it doesnt really matter what the other thing is to be honest as long as it makes sense in some extremely extremely abstracted way. aka, youre allowed to do basically anything along with eating burrata as long as youre doing something else. oh, you cant just do burrata and bread though, sorry, you have to put the burrata in a beautiful bowl, preferably a small low bowl. and then you pour good olive oil on it and then flaky salt. from there you can do other things too. two nights ago, which wasnt my birthday because my birthday was 3 nights ago, i had burrata with flaky-ish salt and black pepper and ruth's zaatar. it was really good. there doesnt really exist bad burrata is the thing, even the trader joes stuff is really good because at the end of the day youre basically eating creme with salt and bread and people used to crave this more than you could ever imagine. they couldnt even salt it to the extreme that i did. somehow i still feel bad in general even though i can eat burrata basically whenever i want with moderately good to very good hot bread whenever i want. maybe i should want to more, i dont know what that would feel like.
