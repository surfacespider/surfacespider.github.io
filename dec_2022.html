		on monday, yesterday, talya and i talked for a few hours while quinn and simona went to a union meeting. we talked about weil. i tried to express my interest and like for weil without having to elaborate and without giving off the wrong impression of my beliefs in god or godly things or things like god. i dont know if i succeeded or what success is in this context

		friday. i went on a long walk today. hour and a half. most of it wasnt spent walking but enough of it was that i would call it a walk. i had read a poetry book that i ordered months ago before going on this walk. it's called every book is about the same thing. when i set off for the walk i thought to my self "palliative, this is palliative" then thought "no, this isn't palliative, walks arent supposed to be palliative" then googled what palliative meant and thought "this walk is to make me feel more insane than that book made me feel"  i now have an intense desire to direct my attention towards something deserving.
