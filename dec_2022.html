		on monday, yesterday, talya and i talked for a few hours while quinn and simona went to a union meeting. we talked about weil. i tried to express my interest and like for weil without having to elaborate and without giving off the wrong impression of my beliefs in god or godly things or things like god. i dont know if i succeeded or what success is in this context

		friday. i went on a long walk today. hour and a half. most of it wasnt spent walking but enough of it was that i would call it a walk. i had read a poetry book that i ordered months ago before going on this walk. it's called every book is about the same thing. when i set off for the walk i thought to my self "palliative, this is palliative" then thought "no, this isn't palliative, walks arent supposed to be palliative" then googled what palliative meant and thought "this walk is to make me feel more insane than that book made me feel"  i now have an intense desire to direct my attention towards something deserving.

		(about noon) i spent so long grading exams for these students yesterday and i kept getting really annoyed and too upset when they answered things in annoying ways that made me grade slower and spend more time on it when i could have been doing literally anything else. it took like ten hours. i was being mean and taking off too many points but got nicer at the end so im sorry for the people directly in the middle of the grading group who i was the meanest to. like all of you have As though so please die and stop making me regrade your exams for .05% of your final grade being bumped up. i was slouched over for most of it. im wearing the same shirt i was wearing yesterday while i graded today. it's a mother's band shirt. i finished mao ii this morning. it got worse the more i read. at the beginning he describes someone watching the hillsborough disaster on a muted tv at night. that was beautiful and sad. he described other scenes not as beautifully or as sad, nor as chaotic and aggressive. atleast not as much as i wanted them to be.
