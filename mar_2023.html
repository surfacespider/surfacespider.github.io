	(5:20 pm) i still havent read everything that leijia hanrahan has written and published online. this makes me feel bad. i write a lot about feeling bad. im going to put in some quotes and phrases fully ripped out of context from her translation of the article 'the irreducible gap': "the search for parallelisms rather than implications turns out to be equivocal" "The indifferent becoming of matter and the predominance of consciousness" "Gold = festivals = joy = splendor" "Money must negate itself as a commodity in order to become an external intermediary" "Sexual history is marked by two essential facts: 1) The negation of feminine sexuality. 2) The displacement of sexuality out of the productive sphere specific to man" "The search for links that might put an end, at least on a theoretical level, to the separation between the various moments of social organization has thus far avoided neither partiality nor abstractness" "the less a woman's sexuality is covered by other structures (material, religious, ideological) the more it reveals its violent and forced kinship with motherhood, illness and death" <a href="https://illwill.com/the-irreducible-gap" target="_blank"> here</a> is a link to the article. it was pretty okay. i didnt process most of it or even enough to determine if it was good outside of the things ive quoted. i'll reread it later after ive finished the things leijia has written as opposed to things shes translated. albeit, the difference between translation and writing isnt all the big.
