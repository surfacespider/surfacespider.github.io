	(5:20 pm) i still havent read everything that leijia hanrahan has written and published online. this makes me feel bad. i write a lot about feeling bad. im going to put in some quotes and phrases fully ripped out of context from her translation of the article 'the irreducible gap': "the search for parallelisms rather than implications turns out to be equivocal" "The indifferent becoming of matter and the predominance of consciousness" "Gold = festivals = joy = splendor" "Money must negate itself as a commodity in order to become an external intermediary" "Sexual history is marked by two essential facts: 1) The negation of feminine sexuality. 2) The displacement of sexuality out of the productive sphere specific to man" "The search for links that might put an end, at least on a theoretical level, to the separation between the various moments of social organization has thus far avoided neither partiality nor abstractness" "the less a woman's sexuality is covered by other structures (material, religious, ideological) the more it reveals its violent and forced kinship with motherhood, illness and death" <a href="https://illwill.com/the-irreducible-gap" target="_blank"> here</a> is a link to the article. it was pretty okay. i didnt process most of it or even enough to determine if it was good outside of the things ive quoted. i'll reread it later after ive finished the things leijia has written as opposed to things shes translated. albeit, the difference between translation and writing isnt all the big.

	(11:26 am) so much time. such a big delay. it felt like i just wrote this previous entry like i just read those things by leijia but its been over a week. i dreamed i was in ny last night i dreamed i was in a hotel and it had a lobby on the 15th floor. so many people were going around, checking in, going about their day. i wasnt paying attention to them. how boring. there were many people in my room. some were people i knew. why are hotels so stale why are so many places so stale. as if you arent supposed to be there. im on the 3rd floor of the caltech library. caltechs librarys are boring and feel like youre not supposed to be there. the library study space in the other building thats on the 9th floor of that building closes at 5pm. why arent i supposed to be there. its a stale room, the seats for studying in are sectioned off with frail plastic dividers. there are large windows on the north side of the building that let you see a wide view of the san gabriel mountains. none of the sectioned of area for studying have this taken into account. the seats are low, the rims of the windows are high, even standing there the windows are too high. im currently reading zeros + ones by sadie plant. isnt weaving so beautiful, dont you thing that your clothes are beautiful. your clothes should be beautiful. just because they were woven. looms were the first computers, the first applications of algorithms and predictions. of taking a pattern and repeating itself into its own structure continuously. my shirt's weave only goes over and under in maybe two near identical colors but thats still beautiful.
