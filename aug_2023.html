		(almost 7pm) i remembered that silly description of ursula k le guin's daily routine and i can't stop thinking about the 3 hour gap she leaves for making dinner and eating it. i should leave 3 hours for making dinner and eating it every day. turning off my phone every day at the same time. turning on background music (why have i been listening to so little music recently). prepping a full meal. that three hours would obviously include my walk home and the trip to the grocery store. you should go to the grocery store more often, you shouldn't hold onto things in your fridge for so long. plants should only exist for maybe a few days after being picked before being eaten. the three hours would include cleaning up. it would include staring out the window for a little too long and the trees that make me feel uneasy and at the trees the make me feel calm (it's the same trees). three hours is such a long time. it's far longer than most things ive dedicated my time to at any one time. how ever much attention im giving isnt enough. today i chewed all of my nails down to shortness that hurts. yesterday i thought i should give similes a chance in my own writing. tomorrow ill make dinner and ill spend all three hours considering every action i take.

	<p>(dinner time but im waiting for simona) there are places you cannot go. as soon as you become aware of them the distance becomes real rather than virtual; an actual barrier forms that you cannot pass. theres a collection of books i have by eliot porter, an american photographer. he mainly took nature photos. he took some of the last photos of glen canyon. </p>

	<h4>august 4th</h4>
	<p>(almost 1 pm) simona came home so i got distracted and cooked and ate dinner instead of finishing my thought. glen canyon was dammed and is now a recreation area and lake and hydroelectric generator. i have never been to and most likely never will go. but also, even if glen canyon was in the state it is in in the photos, if it had never been dammed up, if the colorado still flowed freely and the sun were to shine onto and mainly strike the sides of the canyon still (its far too steep and deep for sunlight to hit the bottom much) and was filled with moss and tall grass and damp sand and wind buffeted trees, i still wouldnt go. there really isnt anything for me there. ive never been to sequoia national park and ive never been to yosemite. both are on the way to lake tahoe which i have been to many times, but ive never been to tahoe because of the lake in particular. if i didnt know people that lived there i would never have gone. if they left there would be a suddenly real barrier stopping me from going. by real barrier im just saying, that i cant go. i wont go. cant and wont are often the same word to me. combining them makes me feel like when i complain about things its in a useless way as opposed to a victim way. instead of elaborating on this or anything else ive said im going to continue scanning/photographing the eliot porter book and eat lunch and edit the scans/photos together and upload that to instagram in such a way that lets people know that not only do i have good taste, but i also am capable of producing something beautiful that aligns with their aesthetic sensibilities in such a way that they think more highly of me.</p>
