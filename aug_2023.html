		(almost 7pm) i remembered that silly description of ursula k le guin's daily routine and i can't stop thinking about the 3 hour gap she leaves for making dinner and eating it. i should leave 3 hours for making dinner and eating it every day. turning off my phone every day at the same time. turning on background music (why have i been listening to so little music recently). prepping a full meal. that three hours would obviously include my walk home and the trip to the grocery store. you should go to the grocery store more often, you shouldn't hold onto things in your fridge for so long. plants should only exist for maybe a few days after being picked before being eaten. the three hours would include cleaning up. it would include staring out the window for a little too long and the trees that make me feel uneasy and at the trees the make me feel calm (it's the same trees). three hours is such a long time. it's far longer than most things ive dedicated my time to at any one time. how ever much attention im giving isnt enough. today i chewed all of my nails down to shortness that hurts. yesterday i thought i should give similes a chance in my own writing. tomorrow ill make dinner and ill spend all three hours considering every action i take.
