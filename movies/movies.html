	<b>nosferatu (2024)</b> - robert eggers - watched january 5th 2025. it was fine i liked it but i think any criticism i levy against it would have to be bounded by how similar he was trying to make it compared to the original and i havent seen it lol <br>
	<b>woman in the dunes</b> - hiroshi teshigahara - watched jan 20th 2025 i had a horrible mental experience while watching this and felt more trapped and incapable of escaping than anyone in this movie. i fell asleep like 15 min from the end lol<br>
	<b>the wayward cloud</b> - tsai ming-liang - this is partially a funny musical that ends with a like ten minute rape scene of an unconcious woman while the protagonist watches and its a symbol of like poor communication hmmmm <br> 
	<b>naked lunch</b> - david cronenberg - most homoerotic not homoerotic movie of all time. about 25 minutes too long. i enjoyed it and got a t shirt <br>
	<b>nostalgia</b> - tarkovsky - i loved this. it made me feel crazy and upset. i feel crazy and upset. i wish it were only so simple that there was a single action one could take to save themselves or others or to even take in general <br>
