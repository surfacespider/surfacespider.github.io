	(afternoon) ive decided to start putting the date i finished books when i write my little blurb in my books ive finished in 2023 section of my blog. ive also decided to create wine section because i think that would be so me that it would be funny. actually only if i think its funny enough to do that next time i drink wine. it would have to be really funny because i cant update this using my phone because my ios is so out of date: i have to use my laptop and my laptop had been broken for months and months where i have to plug it in for it to turn on and having to plug it in ruins a lot of the fun in just pulling something out and expressing yourself. and by expressing myself i mean doing tasting notes in a serious not so serious gauche not so gauche way that i find funny. i got sick at the hyper pop show that sucked that i went to with kian. i think gauche is the wrong word to use here.

	(10:30 am) im sick of assignments and having to grieve. i will continue to do the second. im weeks behind on the first. the day i learned that coffee places dont actually give you more espresso in larger sizes, they just give you more milk was the most important day of my life. the other most important day of my life was the day i started carrying around a mountain valley spring water bottle as my reusable water bottle. another most important day of my life was when i ordered new perfume. and another most important day of my life is when i first went to delia's and got chilaquiles. next most important day of my life is the second time i read calling a wolf a wolf. another most important day of my life is when i got bangs. after that was the day i got those bangs trimmed. yet another most important day of my life is when i decided to go to the caltech library with the view of the mountains instead of the one one i normally go to. one of the most important days of my life is the day i started my blog. the most important day of my life is when i bought A V60 pourover in a beautiful earthy ceramic green. the most important day of my life is the day my father stopped being mysterious to me. the most important day of my life is the day i first listened to the natural bridge by silver jews. the most important day of my life is when i went to boka in chicago and had the most enjoyable meal of my life. one of the most important days of my life is those days in indiana in late october when the trees would be blowing in the wind and itd be so quiet.

	(7:42 pm) there are tall grasses on the hills behind the house i grew up in. i was there today. the grasses used to only be on the top of the hill. they have spread down from the top and now cover the sides. they blow in the wind so easily. theyre seed laden and top heavy, they sway slowly even though the wind is fast. so so fast. the tall grasses cover all of the hills around the house i grew up in. the lawns are covered in grass and trees that i remember being much smaller. the grass on the lawns is much much shorter and much much greener than the grasses on the hills. the grass on the lawns doesnt sway in the wind. the grass on the hills cant spread any farther because there are no more hills to cover. the grass on the hills is sandy and brown and not green at all. in a week the heat will spike and the grasses will die back and then there will only be grasses on the lawns and maybe on the top of the hills. if i had my way the grasses on the top of the hills would keep growing down and down and wouldnt be spread apart between hills and roads and lawns of green so that i wouldnt have to look up and far away to see the grasses sway in the wind.

	(10 am) i have recently decided that slightly larger than normal sized drinks are slightly embarassing. or even normal sized drinks. a latte barely should be 12 oz. an 11 oz latte is perfect. a cappucino/flat white should be 8 oz. sodas can be 20oz but 32? no awful horrible. disgusting even. i dont mean this in a european way, i never mean anything in a european way. dont accuse me of supporting anything european even if you have seen or heard me actually saying positive things about european concepts or ways of life or cities or cultures or anything else. this support of small drinks is 100% fueled by aesthetic sensibilities and pretension.

	(noon) im on a book buying hiatus until i read all of the books ive bought on my book buying non-hiatus (the entire past two years). to say a spree would be over exaggerating maybe. i am no longer able to say ive read "most of the books in my pile on the floor" i can only say ive finished a plurality of them. or that ive finished a lot and started a lot too. im currently finishing up franny and zooey by salinger which is a funny thing to say because the book isnt that long. its actually really short and an easy read so saying im finishing it up makes it sound much more involved than it is. actually just typing this short post is really just delaying the finishing up of the book i could finish it during my lunch break. during the next 30 minutes i have before i start feeling mildly bad about not having finished my homework from weeks ago. i dont feel bad about it actually i just want it done so i can stop thinking about it and instead think about more important things like tall grasses or perfume or silver or paper.

	(11 am) spent the previous week in mexico city. i love mexico city and you should too. narkis kept talking about how he doesnt want to be one of those americans that moves to mexico city because its so so cheap and great then would end whatever variation of saying this with "but i get it" i get it too. i can see myself going back again and again. im planning on going back again and again. my flight there was delayed because of ash from an erupting volacno. i may not be able to follow through on my plan to go back again and again. the area we stayed in is called la condesa. brendan told me that mexico city is really actually a collection of different towns and cities that combined together to make the current city. each neighborhood has its own architecture and history and structure and layout that is partly separate from the rest. la condesa is an old european section i think, the street signs are placed on the side of the buildings like in europe, the buildings are almost all apartments anywhere from 2 to 15 stories tall built anywhere from the late 19th century to this year. most of the buildings i saw were from the early 20th century. there was a lot of art deco and beautiful structures and wide avenues and so so many trees and so so many cafes. ive never seen so many cafes. it felt wrong walking past so many cafes to go to a particular one. it felt wrong not going to two different cafes every morning and still not seeing all of them and being unable to choose a favorite.
