		(4:30 pm) just finished a journal club. sitting outside. feeling tired dehydrated sick ill and also ill. i wanted a large sandwich so bad so im going to miss out on my new tradition of eating lambchops on the floor... instead im going to make chocolat pot de creme in my new pumpkin cocottes. (3 hours later) im so off i got half and half instead of cream but its fine. i didnt strain the custard because i dont have anything possible of straining anything. i dont own a dish deep enough to pour water half way up my cocottes so theyre overbaked. but its fine. i have to wait 4 hours now for them to cool which is also fine... im wearing my apron and drinking water out of a green mountain valley spring water bottle this is more than fine this is so so so good. its the only way ill drink water at home from now. new traditions. i must have so many traditions and patterns so that everytime i break one i have another to fall back on. over and over and over always turning one way and looking back.
