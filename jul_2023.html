		(9 pm) dont worry everyone ive figure out everything. everything makes sense now and all of the writing and everything will proceed unnaturally smoothly from now on. simona gave me their laptop they accidentally took (stole) from germany so now im a mac girle. on the 4th of july a doll called me an "alt lit girlie" so im that too. after i said yes to this she immediately brought up someone i have never read or even heard of, but none of that matters because simona told me how to use git on my new stolen mac. im a command line girlie now. going to change it to green text on a black background. going to type only in the dark like i am now. when was my last update? it doesnt matter. all that matters is i can type now and my laptop doesnt have to be plugged into the wall for it to turn on. my screen is no longer broken which is a minus though because i found the purple and green so pleasing and it made me so aware of something. i dont know what but of something. ive read two books sense my last update. not a lot but enough. another mfk fisher book and a 1913 german scifi about a kind star and selfless beings. both were good but the mfk fisher book convinced me to buy a bunch of sherry and drink it constantly and that is more directly impactful to my day to day life. i just gooled the actual name of the mfk fisher book and i have the lame cover because im a local bookstore girlie now. i need to be the most fuckable on the stories back patio for some reason (not no reason but some potentially unknown reason. (because what else is there to do isnt a very good reason)) i like mfk fisher a lot and will keep reading her and will read everything she wrote maybe ill even make some of her recipes she writes down, i think she has actualy cookbooks but everything ive read by her is more like her dicking around and telling little stories about food and eating then throwing a mostly useless recipe at the end. well, not mostly useless to me. earlier, i dont remember when, but earlier i wrote some recipes in some posts that were descriptive but not quantitative. qualitative at best. hers read like those if they were actually trying to tell you what to do. i would never tell you what to do i would only describe to you how great those cool wax beans are and what i did to (try to) make them. i have covid.
