		(10:30 pm) i need to stop buying sapporo i need to stop buying sapporo from the closest convenience store with beer to me. i dont know why i said buying, i only did it once and it cost about one hundred million dollars more than walking to the brand new h-mart that opened up only ten minutes away from me. i need to not buy sapporo not because its too expensive but because its bad. heres' a recommendation from me, buy the cheapest sake you can find and pour it into an asahi thats exctremely cold. heres another recommendation, dont drink sapporo. another recommendation, buy vintage stoneware on ebay and only use beautiful plates and bowls and mugs to consume anything you eat. one last recommendation (for now and specifically for me) buy lead paint testing kits if you buy vintage dishes and plan on touching them ever; fyi all of the ones on amazon are fake; fyi i havent tested any of my dishes for lead.

	<p>(10 am) ive finally almost fully set myself up fully forever in my apartment and will never have any more issues ever again. i have a kettle (thats filling me with micro plastics) i have a beautiful 1.8 qt sauce pan (that they say isnt dishwasher safe but totally is if you arent a loser about it) and a cutting board (perfect also) and no furniture and no tables and no chairs and it was so hard to eat miso soup yesterday and i made too much miso soup, but it was my fault for having poorly shaped bowls and no soup spoon only normal spoons and not knowing measurements. but no issues will arise from now on because these arent issues theyre life decisions. as soon as you get something you have to have to for a while and i dont want to have anything around that i dont want to have around forever anymore. what i mean is i am paralyzed by the possibility that i will purhcase the wrong size tongs. i am unable to visualize sizes in my head and usability of things in my head easily. i just remembered i dont have any forks... i will fix that soon... i will come back and finish this thought later i am going on a journey to getting cheap dumplings. </p>

	<p>(8:42 am) its been one week since the 22nd anniversary of 9/11. i didnt notice anything different about being in ny for that anniversary vs being anywhere else. this is my current shopping list: 
green sparkly eye shadow
cointreau
limes
vinegar
sugar
yogurt
pepper
hot sauce
sesame oil
umbrella 
sparkling water
aperitivo/vermouth
coca cola
dashi powder
mirin
sake
kombu
white beans
orzata
dijon
mortadella
can opener
flour
olives
cottage cheese
herbs de provence
chicken thighs
shallots
herbes fines
green onions
cheese
candle (boy smells)
i've decided to add more things after reading this: 
a couch
a dining table
atleast 3 chairs
something to strengthen my finger nails
radish
3 qt saucier
many of these are connected to eachother and many are not. the most important things in here i think are orzata, aperitvo/vermouth, sparkling water, cointreau, and shallots. i really want to drink something new and delicious and i really want to pour cointreau into all of this sapporo i have to drink because i forgot i dont like sapporo before i drank it and i really want to dice something so fine and tiny and perfectly using my brand new knife. simple pleasures simple wants eternal life
