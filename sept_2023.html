		(10:30 pm) i need to stop buying sapporo i need to stop buying sapporo from the closest convenience store with beer to me. i dont know why i said buying, i only did it once and it cost about one hundred million dollars more than walking to the brand new h-mart that opened up only ten minutes away from me. i need to not buy sapporo not because its too expensive but because its bad. heres' a recommendation from me, buy the cheapest sake you can find and pour it into an asahi thats exctremely cold. heres another recommendation, dont drink sapporo. another recommendation, buy vintage stoneware on ebay and only use beautiful plates and bowls and mugs to consume anything you eat. one last recommendation (for now and specifically for me) buy lead paint testing kits if you buy vintage dishes and plan on touching them ever; fyi all of the ones on amazon are fake; fyi i havent tested any of my dishes for lead.
