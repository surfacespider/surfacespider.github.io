</p>
<p>
	<b> considering how exaggerated music is </b> (poetry) - leslie scalapino - finished january 5th, really liked <br>
	<b>how to cook a wolf</b> (food/literature) - mfk fisher - finished january 6th, started sometime in the second half of 2022 <br>
	<b>death wish</b> (poetry) - ben fama - first book i finished, got delivered like 3 months late. it was fine <br>
	<b>dictee</b> (poetry and prose) - therese hak kyung cha - finished jan 12th, i could probably read this two more times before i began to actually understand it. id recommend. <br>
	<b>eros the bittersweet</b> (essay) - anne carson - finished jan 17th. recommend if you like to read about desire and the classics <br>
	<b>glass, irony, and god</b> (verse and an essay) - anne carson - finished jan 23rd? one of the best things ive read, anne carson is just better at writing than all of us (un)fortunately. <br>
	<b>on earth we're briefly gorgeous</b> (novel) - ocean vuong - more proof to never go to connecticut <br>
	<b> autobiography of red</b> (verse novel) - anne carson - i finished this while at a bar on sunday the 4th and someone walked by and said that book is so good. it is so good. the bar had an outdoor patio i was basically on the sidewalk. <br>
