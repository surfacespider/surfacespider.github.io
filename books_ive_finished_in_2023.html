<p>
	<b> considering how exaggerated music is </b> (poetry) - leslie scalapino - finished january 5th, really liked <br>
	<b>how to cook a wolf</b> (food/literature) - mfk fisher - finished january 6th, started sometime in the second half of 2022 <br>
	<b>death wish</b> (poetry) - ben fama - first book i finished, got delivered like 3 months late. it was fine <br>
	<b>dictee</b> (poetry and prose) - therese hak kyung cha - finished jan 12th, i could probably read this two more times before i began to actually understand it. id recommend. <br>
	<b>eros the bittersweet</b> (essay) - anne carson - finished jan 17th. recommend if you like to read about desire and the classics <br>
	<b>glass, irony, and god</b> (verse and an essay) - anne carson - finished jan 23rd? one of the best things ive read, anne carson is just better at writing than all of us (un)fortunately. <br>
	<b>on earth we're briefly gorgeous</b> (novel) - ocean vuong - more proof to never go to connecticut <br>
	<b> autobiography of red</b> (verse novel) - anne carson - i finished this while at a bar on sunday the 4th and someone walked by and said that book is so good. it is so good. the bar had an outdoor patio i was basically on the sidewalk. <br>
	<b>i am ready to die a violent death</b> (poetry) - heiko julien - early 2010s poetry about love and feeling bad. it was okay <br>
	<b>winter recipes from the collective</b> (poetry) - louise gluck - this is what my feb 12th post is about. it made me feel bad <br>
	<b>antoning artaud collected works vol 1</b> (mainly letters) - finished feb 20th, most of these are whatever, some of them are the funniest or most important things ive read... maybe. <br>
	<b>decreation</b> (poetry and others) - anne carson - not as good as the other things ive read, but still good. described and used the color green in a way that made me feel insane. <br>
	<b>orlando</b> (novel) - virginia woolf - 19th century writing and earlier(even though this was was published in 1924 it was clearly going for a 19th century and earlier feel for much of it aka it was satirizing it and fucking with you) requires so much attention compared to everything else and makes you love how much goes into writing. <br>
	<b>harassment architectyre</b> - mike ma - dont read this lol <br>
