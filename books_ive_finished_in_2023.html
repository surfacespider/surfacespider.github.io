	<b>death wish</b> (poetry) - ben fama - first book i finished, got delivered like 3 months late. it was fine <br>
	<b>dictee</b> (poetry and prose) - therese hak kyung cha - finished jan 12th, i could probably read this two more times before i began to actually understand it. id recommend. <br>

	<b>glass, irony, and god</b> (verse and an essay) - anne carson - finished jan 23rd? one of the best things ive read, anne carson is just better at writing than all of us (un)fortunately. <br>
	<b>on earth we're briefly gorgeous</b> (novel) - ocean vuong - more proof to never go to connecticut <br>
	<b> autobiography of red</b> (verse novel) - anne carson - i finished this while at a bar on sunday the 4th and someone walked by and said that book is so good. it is so good. the bar had an outdoor patio i was basically on the sidewalk. <br>
	<b>i am ready to die a violent death</b> (poetry) - heiko julien - early 2010s poetry about love and feeling bad. it was okay <br>
	<b>winter recipes from the collective</b> (poetry) - louise gluck - this is what my feb 12th post is about. it made me feel bad <br>
	<b>antoning artaud collected works vol 1<b/> (mainly letters) - finished feb 20th, most of these are whatever, some of them are the funniest or most important things ive read... maybe.
