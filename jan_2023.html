	(a little after 10 am) i am going to walk to a coffee shop and read a book and maybe even consider eating something sweet while im there. ill bring my journal that isnt my journal anymore because ive decided that this is my journal and that when i was journaling in my book it was combing my writing and my journaling in a way that i wasnt really writing i was journaling well instead. this makes sense to me. also you should have multiple forms of media that you engage in and that you participate in, mine are typing and writing. happy new year.
