	(a little after 10 am) i am going to walk to a coffee shop and read a book and maybe even consider eating something sweet while im there. ill bring my journal that isnt my journal anymore because ive decided that this is my journal and that when i was journaling in my book it was combing my writing and my journaling in a way that i wasnt really writing i was journaling well instead. this makes sense to me. also you should have multiple forms of media that you engage in and that you participate in, mine are typing and writing. happy new year.

	(noonish) im so sore, i climbed yesterday and the day before. mobility is in for 2023: mobility and body weight exercises. lifting weights is so out. being insane and overwhelemd all the time is still in.. maybe even more in. rambling everywhere and about everything is also in. black out writing is in. so sore. already missing days need to write more and more. i have to ta, will probably audit one of my classes so i will only be taking two. need more time to ramble and write. im debating whether to have images next to my posts, or to link to images in the post that go to a separate web page. ill probably do both. need to learn how to do the first... painted nails are in.

	(11:50 pm) im drinking water, sleepy time honey tea, and suze with ice. these are all in different cups, not the same one. i often put like 10 things on my bed then wonder why i dont sleep well. dont judge me when i say i have a  L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets book, a 1942 lifestyle/cooking book, a new translation of the new testament, dictee (a novella about language and women), airpods, bluetooth headphones, my ipad, and my laptop (as well as actual bed stuffs) this is even funnier to me because i have the smallest flattest and most singular of pillows on my bed. its case doesnt even match my sheets or my style. i dont know where the case or the pillow came from. everything else is linen and the case is definitely some kind of weird polyester blend that comes out of the washer barely wet and out of the dryer extremely dry and hot. i have no incentive to replace it. pillow cases come in pairs. i dont think pillows come in pairs but i do refuse to have mismatched pillows and refuse to either have three pillows or get rid of or store away this pillow.
