	<b>nosferatu (2024)</b> - robert eggers - watched january 5th 2025. it was fine i liked it but i think any criticism i levy against it would have to be bounded by how similar he was trying to make it compared to the original and i havent seen it lol <br>
	<b>woman in the dunes</b> - hiroshi teshigahara - watched jan 20th 2025 i had a horrible mental experience while watching this and felt more trapped and incapable of escaping than anyone in this movie. i fell asleep like 15 min from the end lol<br>
	<b>the wayward cloud</b> - tsai ming-liang - this is partially a funny musical that ends with a like ten minute rape scene of an unconcious woman while the protagonist watches and its a symbol of like poor communication hmmmm <br>
