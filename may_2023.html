	(afternoon) ive decided to start putting the date i finished books when i write my little blurb in my books ive finished in 2023 section of my blog. ive also decided to create wine section because i think that would be so me that it would be funny. actually only if i think its funny enough to do that next time i drink wine. it would have to be really funny because i cant update this using my phone because my ios is so out of date: i have to use my laptop and my laptop had been broken for months and months where i have to plug it in for it to turn on and having to plug it in ruins a lot of the fun in just pulling something out and expressing yourself. and by expressing myself i mean doing tasting notes in a serious not so serious gauche not so gauche way that i find funny. i got sick at the hyper pop show that sucked that i went to with kian. i think gauche is the wrong word to use here.
