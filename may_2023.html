	(afternoon) ive decided to start putting the date i finished books when i write my little blurb in my books ive finished in 2023 section of my blog. ive also decided to create wine section because i think that would be so me that it would be funny. actually only if i think its funny enough to do that next time i drink wine. it would have to be really funny because i cant update this using my phone because my ios is so out of date: i have to use my laptop and my laptop had been broken for months and months where i have to plug it in for it to turn on and having to plug it in ruins a lot of the fun in just pulling something out and expressing yourself. and by expressing myself i mean doing tasting notes in a serious not so serious gauche not so gauche way that i find funny. i got sick at the hyper pop show that sucked that i went to with kian. i think gauche is the wrong word to use here.

	(10:30 am) im sick of assignments and having to grieve. i will continue to do the second. im weeks behind on the first. the day i learned that coffee places dont actually give you more espresso in larger sizes, they just give you more milk was the most important day of my life. the other most important day of my life was the day i started carrying around a mountain valley spring water bottle as my reusable water bottle. another most important day of my life was when i ordered new perfume. and another most important day of my life is when i first went to delia's and got chilaquiles. next most important day of my life is the second time i read calling a wolf a wolf. another most important day of my life is when i got bangs. after that was the day i got those bangs trimmed. yet another most important day of my life is when i decided to go to the caltech library with the view of the mountains instead of the one one i normally go to. one of the most important days of my life is the day i started my blog. the most important day of my life is when i bought A V60 pourover in a beautiful earthy ceramic green. the most important day of my life is the day my father stopped being mysterious to me. the most important day of my life is the day i first listened to the natural bridge by silver jews. the most important day of my life is when i went to boka in chicago and had the most enjoyable meal of my life. one of the most important days of my life is those days in indiana in late october when the trees would be blowing in the wind and itd be so quiet.
