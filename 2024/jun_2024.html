		(late afternoon) im dehydrated, im so thirsty i could die. im so upset. i could ruin so much. ive only had one diet coke today, im going to have another. it will have lime and ill put it in a cup with ice. the joys of life are so simple. im on my balcony, a building across from me, the tallest building near me has black smoke rising out from a vent on top. it's too warm to be from heating; they must be still choosing a pope. it feels like its been so long since i came home. i left work at 3 because i couldnt imagine getting anything done in the time i would be there. 4 maybe 5 maybe 6 periods of thirty minutes. half hours on earth what are they worth i dont know. the sun sets so late here and the berries are ripe for picking for those with open eyes and open hearts. sitting on my balcony i can only think of my teeth shifting so slowly, of how i wore my retainer every night for so long and finally when i was about 20 i decided i had enough. it was unnecessary. i abandoned it slowly and without care until, if i wished to continue the pattern, id have to pull my teeth back in. i think thats a bit much.

		when i decide to rest, or force myself to sleep, when i lay down i take the inside part of my left arm, i take the crook of my arm and i lay it across my eyes. it's the most melodramatic way to lay down. a deep sigh of resignation. it guarantees that its dark, that nothing outside of me will disturb my eyes' rest. ill set an alarm for only about 20-30 minutes even if i intend to rest for an hour or more. i dont intend to sleep only to lay down and rest. the alarm prevents me from entering an actual deep sleep. when the alarm wakes me up i set it again so that i can go back to resting my eyes. during these intervals of half wakefulness, i have extremely vivid memories that bleed over into my half sleep. im inducing experience back onto itself. i force my experiences back onto myself. i think of where ive been. i think of every recent conversation and how much more attention i wish i would pay to everything and everyone. its grass like this that will drive you insane. its this one unending vision of trees that will drive you crazy. nearly all living mass on earth is taken up by trees. i think of the wind blowing through all of them. of the wind blowing through a specific tree that changes all the time. there are only a few specific trees in my life: the one outside of simonas window that i could see through the window from that green green couch, the ones below my current apartment that house so so many birds that you can only notice in the early morning, the one out front my house in santa clarita that i would swing on until i broke the branch that hung over the side walk, the one behind my house in santa clarita was that there before the house was built and is no longer there while the house is still built, i cant think of any others but there are others (there is always others). theres more to say, there's always mroe to say, but i will rest now. maybe even sleep. without an alarm who knows but my arm will be covering my eyes and it will be silent in my room.
