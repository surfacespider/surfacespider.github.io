		i took a walk today down the hill i grew up on to the park i grew up next to. i never really went to this park. its close, but not that close, to a child it is so so far away, we werent allowed to go that far alone, to a tired parent its also very far away to walk to.

		(7 am) ordered perfumes using my moms apple card for myself for christmas. specific days of giving are silly to me even if there really isnt a difference between giving on a specific day and giving around the expected time. i usually end up giving around the expected time instead of on the expected day. choosing the things for myself at the desired time. someone shoulds psychoanalyze this about me and not tell me or hold it against me if it reveals negative unaddressed issues that make my relationships worse, and eventually, when i do address and grow and make amends with myself and others, send me an anonymous letter or somehow an anonymous email saying how proud you are of me. i will then become very upset and anxious for a small and particular amount of time that someone knew that only a single phrase and description and realization could have helped me, but that it was withheld. the clandestine (i just relearned what the word clandestine means) nature of this task may be difficult to bear, so only those who think they are capable of a multi year commitment to me should even begin to attempt this. only people who are capable of at least a one year commitment (2024 being the year) should involve themselves. this is the year of intensity. of pulling and pushing and connecting to others in a way that is deserving of our own vita and virginia woolf letters equivalent (i have not read the letters between vita and virgina woolf and only imagine that this not only makes sense but isnt a horribly toxic and potential life ruining things to seek out)

		waiting on emails waiting on texts waiting to go home and buy more vases while having no chairs... flowers for my vases in the middle of january will be lovely. ill get a bed frame soon so that i can feel more put together as in so that i can sit while eating without my food being on the floor or myself. my meals will become intentional and plated with maybe too much care. i actually did my budget and included money i think i owe the government and my budget to live on per month is actually like only $500 a month. which is a fine amount, less sacai skirts to be sure, but im already so lovely and the best art is made within limitations. realized im going to get a gym member ship so its actually $400... this is also acceptable...
