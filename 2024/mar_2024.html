		(so so late in the day) reading walter benjamin, always reading and rereading walter benjamin and feeling bad. there is not difference between the major and the minor events of the world. i feel so sick that i believe i am capable of discerning. that ive discerned and decided and still do that ive become uninvolved in anything that has ever happened. please buy my marni loafers, theyre a size 43 but theyre really more like a 44 or maybe even like a 44.5 its wild who approved of this sizing, is the brands quality control that bad? theres no way that it was this clearly and purposely made and then just sized so so wrong. my feet slide out of them i wore large socks and my feet still slid out of them. if i wore large socks and had large insoles put in my feet would still slide out of them. unwearable. if i wore them i would be a target. if i had to run i wouldnt id walk with my feet sliding out because touching the ground outside is forbidden except for my shoes and when youre grabbing something cute and free like a lighter. or a pen. you should only touch the ground when youre sitting on it really. please someone  buy these loafers off me. theyre actually so nice its just that none of my outfits go with them, none of my pants are lovingly large and pillow out and layer down onto them. i would mind being so vulnerable while out in ny. if lived in la still id embrace that vulnerability because that make sense. how far would i have to walk? 100 feet? id willingly walk 100 steps with my feet slipping out in a very silly way, unable to protect or defend myself. willing to accept an unbecoming end that was brought onto myself due to my own choices. this is what life is about, but here, here where i have to walk so so far, it wouldnt make sense. i have to walk so fast everywhere all the time. and if someone saw that i was wearing shoes that are too big, and not on purpose, itd be too much. imagine if someone saw me and realized i wasnt fashionable, or thought that i didnt make every decision with an intense and deep intentionality that pervades my being and make me feel ill. so so ill. they would say something like. no they wouldnt they would think something like, i can tell. i can tell that person didnt size those shoes to be that big on purpose, they thought they were getting a good deal but instead are stuck in a weird limbo situation and are unwilling to let go of the idea of the perfect shoe. were all seeking that perfect shoe but even worse than seeking and not finding is holding onto what shouldnt be. i would be so so embarrassed if i made eye contact with someone and could tell this entire thought process was occurring. id be red in the face for sure.

		(almost 9 pm) in the city. in all of the current cities there is no back and forth between stars of the night and the sun. its just the sun.

	<p>(evening) how embarrassing to not finish typing that last update and coming across as faux wise, but i am committed to never deleting or rewriting or combining posts into a way that makes sense. i was going to write about a passage from blue of noon, but i am now in chicago and my copy of blue of noon is in new york so i will have to write about the feeling of the sun on your eye lids, of looking up and seeing only blue and knowing that that only difference between day and night is that at night the sun no longer overwhelms the rest of the stars everywhere. </p>

		(afternoon in chicago) its the afternoon and im in chicago. its snowing. i just took an hour long bath and read weil's essay on the iliad. its on the iliad but its not really on the iliad. its about force. its about the iliad. its about turning people into things and a push back and forth between glory and defeat and how unfortunately unavoidable it all is. i have only a few more minutes to write before i have to go eat dinner. if i could apply force to my own body and it would bring glory and terror i would do it, but i have to be oh so gentle with my delicate  skin. my back is covered in stretch marks because i was too forceful in my life with my skin. when i get piercings the bleed and pulsate for weeks unwilling to calm down. my helix piercing may never heal we'll see if its still in in a couple of weeks. i got it on a whim, i hurt my ear on a whim. its not even that lovely if im being completely honest. when i sleep i place my hand in a way such that, when i rotate onto my right side, the side that my piercing is on, the side that i actually prefer to sleep on, that i did not consider when i was getting it pierced, i wont rest on the ear itself but instead on some combination of my hand and my face and a tensed back. i havent been sleeping very well recently if im being perfectly honest.
