	<h4>december 7th</h4>
	(evening) 5 maybe 6 maybe 7 years ago i was trying to place a small pin i bought on ebay onto my backpack, the backpack i still have. i slipped and shoved the pin as hard as i could into the tip of my left ring finger. i dont think it bled. it was extremely clean. since then when ever it gets cold, but only in a extended cold way, what i should say is when it gets cold because of winter, that finger aches where i stabbed myself. every year it hurts more. this year i am acutely aware of the pain in the tip of my finger. im saying this because, my life is divided into perspectives: one where im looking down at my hands and so aware of nothing except what is that far away, and another where things are father away. im focused on the near, i look up, i have a slight delay in my eyes focusing, i enter a different perspective. nothing in my hands is somewhere i can go, somewhere that can overwhelm me. no one has ever brought this to me before. does anyone else's vision do this? i think im imagining this. ive never been so tired before. im too aware of my finger hurting, it interrupts everything. it draws my attention down. i look down at my hand, ive rotated it so the palm is up and the tip of the ring finger is the easiest to see. i do this multiple times a day, i dont even think about it, if i could think about it i would still do it. my attention is out of my control. but i dont think about it, my attention is out of my control. im thinking about st augustine right before he converted, or maybe as he was converting, being distraught by his inabiltiy to match his thoughts to his actions. if i could match my thoughts to my actions i think my mouth would water less. i think my apartment would be nice and my sheets would be cleaner and my meals even lovelier. my finger wouldnt ache in the cold because i wouldnt have forced the pin, i would have been more careful. i need to be so much more careful with my attention, i will be so much more careful with my attention because... i dont really know what i have if i dont have even that. i must not have ever had anything. i still dont have anything. some day soon ill have the smallest amount and then ill be satisfied.
