</p>
<p>
	<b> considering how exaggerated music is </b> (poetry) - leslie scalapino - finished january 5th, really liked <br>
	<b>how to cook a wolf</b> (food/literature) - mfk fisher - finished january 6th, started sometime in the second half of 2022 <br>
	<b>death wish</b> (poetry) - ben fama - first book i finished, got delivered like 3 months late. it was fine <br>
	<b>dictee</b> (poetry and prose) - therese hak kyung cha - finished jan 12th, i could probably read this two more times before i began to actually understand it. id recommend. <br>
	<b>eros the bittersweet</b> (essay) - anne carson - finished jan 17th. recommend if you like to read about desire and the classics <br>
	<b>glass, irony, and god</b> (verse and an essay) - anne carson - finished jan 23rd? one of the best things ive read, anne carson is just better at writing than all of us (un)fortunately. <br>
	<b>on earth we're briefly gorgeous</b> (novel) - ocean vuong - more proof to never go to connecticut <br>
	<b> autobiography of red</b> (verse novel) - anne carson - i finished this while at a bar on sunday the 4th and someone walked by and said that book is so good. it is so good. the bar had an outdoor patio i was basically on the sidewalk. <br>
	<b>i am ready to die a violent death</b> (poetry) - heiko julien - early 2010s poetry about love and feeling bad. it was okay <br>
	<b>winter recipes from the collective</b> (poetry) - louise gluck - this is what my feb 12th post is about. it made me feel bad <br>
	<b>antonin artaud collected works vol 1</b> (mainly letters) - finished feb 20th, most of these are whatever, some of them are the funniest or most important things ive read... maybe. <br>
	<b>decreation</b> (poetry and others) - anne carson - not as good as the other things ive read, but still good. described and used the color green in a way that made me feel insane. <br>
	<b>orlando</b> (novel) - virginia woolf - 19th century writing and earlier(even though this was was published in 1924 it was clearly going for a 19th century and earlier feel for much of it aka it was satirizing it and fucking with you) requires so much attention compared to everything else and makes you love how much goes into writing. <br>
	<b>harassment architecture</b> - mike ma - dont read this lol <br>
	<b>bluets</b> (poetry) - maggie nelson - it's funny when poets talk about getting railed in their poems. this was good and made me love the color blue too...  maybe <br>
	<b>the ice cream man and other stories</b> (short stories) - sam pink - i read this in a single day, it's not actually that many words. he comes off far less sad than you'd expect in this <br>
	<b>trans girl suicide museum</b> (memoir? what even is a memoir) - hannah baer - this is really good more people should read things like this. more people should write things like this. i want to write something like this. <br> 
	<b>person</b> (novel) - sam pink - short, a little sad. i liked how he would rewrite chapters to show different emotions from the same experience <br>
	<b>zeros + ones</b> (theory) - sadie plant - first cyber feminism book. starts off talking about weaving and women and ada lovelace. goes towards women and technology in general. looms are just computers and a billion times more important than any actual computer ever used except for this one im currently using to type up my emails to the people in my life <br>
	<b>no one belongs here more than you</b> (fiction) - miranda july - finished may 1st, cute short stories. funny ones even. not cute like the normal definition of cute. <br>
	<b>franny and zooey</b> (fiction) - j.d. salinger - finished may 15th, how cute how sad. so good. i miss my brothers <br>
	<b>jawbone</b> (fiction) - monica ojeda - finished june 10th? maybe earlier. after finishing this i visited simona and bit their ribs. a great book about the hard part of your soft mouth. im glad they told me to read it. <br>
	<b>plainwater</b> (essays and poetry) - anne carson - every year i think of my family and miss my cats more and more <br>
	<b>an alphabet for gourmets</b> (cooking) - mfk fisher - she actually helps with my ed more than basically anything else <br>
	<b>lesabendio: an asteroid novel</b> (sci fi) - paul scheerbart - poor les, beautiful les, i miss your friends and i know you do too. <br>
	<b>early stuff</b> (fiction and poetry) - sam pink - "you are walking past a cemetary, and you think, 'oh yeah, that's right.'" most fine somewhat good often whatever. like 3.5 of his books in one book: selections from i am going to clone myself then kill the clone and eat it, frowns need friends too, no one can do anything worse to you than you can, gerald mcclellan versus nigel benn. the often bad one is frowns need friends too i think. everything else was often good <br>
	<b>there should be flowers</b> (poetry) - joshua jennifer espinoza - very sad and very good <br>
	<b>nox</b> (poetry/epitaph) - anne carson - the person who had my now copy before me wrote the most surface level annoying annotations and doesn't understand love or grief or how to spell schrodinger <br>
	<b>technically man dwells upon this earth</b> (philosophy?) - emilie carriere - (i think shes quebecois and know shes transsexual) - i have never read the word techne so much. i already forgot basically all of her points: something about intelligence something about multiplicity and difference and identity something else probably. i liked it <br>
	<b>the gastronomical me</b> (food writing) - mfk fisher - god i love mfk fisher so much and only really care about being somewhat or even a lot like her. <br>
	<b>a sand book</b> (poetry) - ariana reines - i had this for multiple years before i really even started and then finished it. it was good it was clearly extremely important to her. <br>
	<b>hymns to the night and other selected writings</b> (poetry) - novalis - i need to read more mysticism <br>
	<b>labrynths</b> (short stories) - borges - one of my current professors who also has a phd in philosophy made a joke about borges in class. im going to talk to him about borges and ask him to be on my phd committee. i need to read more magical realism and mysticism <br>
