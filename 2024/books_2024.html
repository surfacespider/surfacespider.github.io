	im trying to read 100 books in 2024, my hopes are appropriately set
</p>
<p>
	<b>the first bad man</b> (fiction) - miranda july - started last year but finished most this year, i like her short story collection better <br>
	<b>martyr</b> (fiction) - kaveh akbar - how autobiographical is this its atleast partially. it made me cry hard but his poetry does that too so i knew that would happen <br>
	<b>moby dick</b> (fiction) - herman melville - pretty good <br>
	<b>blue of noon</b> (fiction) - georges bataille - erotic novella but not erotica
