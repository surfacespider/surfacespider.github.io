	im trying to read 100 books in 2024, my hopes are appropriately set
</p>
<p>
	<b>the first bad man</b> (fiction) - miranda july - started last year but finished most this year, i like her short story collection better <br>
	<b>martyr</b> (fiction) - kaveh akbar - how autobiographical is this its atleast partially. it made me cry hard but his poetry does that too so i knew that would happen <br>
	<b>moby dick</b> (fiction) - herman melville - pretty good <br>
	<b>blue of noon</b> (fiction) - georges bataille - erotic novella but not erotica <br>
	<b>paul takes the form of a mortal girl</b> (fiction) - andrea lawlor - the very last paragraph reminded me of the poem god's justice by anne carson when it really shouldnt have, something about buzzing something about peace in only a moment <br>
	<b>bunny</b> (fiction) - mona awad - i wanted it to be more gruesome <br>
	<b>pastoralia</b> (short stories and a novella) - george saunders - i cant imagine him writing a full novel in his style. a real challenge i bet <br>
	<b>platform</b> (fiction) - michel houellebecq - im tired of mostly pathetic protagonists  <br>
	<b>the elementary particles</b> (fiction) - michel houellebecq - <i>long jerk off motion</i> <br>
	<b>chevengur</b> (fiction) - andrei platonov - i dont actually really believe in hope anymore <br>
