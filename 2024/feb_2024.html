		(1:30 pm) so much of my time is spent feeling confused and unsure unwelcome and ill-fitting. our bodies (we are our bodies) are capable of detecting changes that dont fall into the normal experience and sensations that we expect or that we normally encounter so those changes must be pushed out and extremized and felt in ways that dont align directly with whats happening, because whats happening isn't a direct sensation in a traditional sense. our (my) lives are so busy that weve (ive) lost the alignment and understanding. what im saying is that people used to get shivers and could feel the pressure change and make predicitions on the weather based on how they felt. what im saying is that yesterday it was cloudy and today a high pressure front moved in and pushed all of the clouds away; my body (i) associates a lack of clouds with dying (i hated growing up in santa clarita). what im saying is i didnt even realize that it was sunny today or that the weather had changed but that this feeling of losing clouds is buried into my experiences and that high pressure fronts make me want to die, physically, my body is telling me to die that horrible things are about to happen. how unfortunate because im having such a lovely time. otherwise.
