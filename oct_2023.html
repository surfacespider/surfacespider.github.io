		(10:45 am) yesterday i attempted to go see a jodorowsky movie and was denied by "technical difficulties" (the projector would not work) they gave me a refund and a free movie ticket or just a free movie ticket i dont know. tonight i am seeing paris texas which i know will be good and beautiful. i havent been writing as much as ive wanted to, i havent been reading as much as ive wanted to. ive actually been dedicating a lot of time towards physics and working and learning the things i wish i already knew. i think i do this in general towards so many things, but specifically right now it is towards physics... for better or worse. i am also 100 pages into moby dick and maybe thats also good enough. im also 100 pages or more into many other books and thats fine and good too. today i will get a lot done. today i will cook myself food and do physics and read more moby dick and do laundry and respond to texts and clean my bathroom and sweep my floors and look beautiful in various and multitudinous positions. also maybe buy a very expensive toaster which is the most important thing possible.
