		(10:45 am) yesterday i attempted to go see a jodorowsky movie and was denied by "technical difficulties" (the projector would not work) they gave me a refund and a free movie ticket or just a free movie ticket i dont know. tonight i am seeing paris texas which i know will be good and beautiful. i havent been writing as much as ive wanted to, i havent been reading as much as ive wanted to. ive actually been dedicating a lot of time towards physics and working and learning the things i wish i already knew. i think i do this in general towards so many things, but specifically right now it is towards physics... for better or worse. i am also 100 pages into moby dick and maybe thats also good enough. im also 100 pages or more into many other books and thats fine and good too. today i will get a lot done. today i will cook myself food and do physics and read more moby dick and do laundry and respond to texts and clean my bathroom and sweep my floors and look beautiful in various and multitudinous positions. also maybe buy a very expensive toaster which is the most important thing possible.

		(9:22 am) im surrounded by nerds and am suffering damage directly to my soul. ive switched to drinking coffee with milk to ease my weak weak stomach. ive decided that 1 week of this is bad for my soul so ive gone back to black coffee this morning. im going to drink so much im healed. im going to drink so much im cured of... everything... forever. the coffee is room temp now and tasts like the bottom of a bag of microwaved popcorn. not ideal. good description of most things. not ideal. studying trying to get these problems to make sense in my head and i dont have enough time in the day to get everything done i want done. not ideal. i lack the energy to cook all the meals i want with the intensity i want to after working all day. not ideal. its supposed to be fall but the temperature is still easily warm enough for shorts. not ideal. im wearing shorts and a jacket and clogs rn... this is actually ideal. clogs are ideal. left overs for dinner? not ideal, unless youre into that and i hope you arent. i havent drank enough coffee to start shaking yet. im going to switch to tea for a bit to see if that also works. earl gret is ideal unless its trader joes brand which is the only bad tea ive ever had. except like, maybe lipton. i reall like living in new york and have been mostly satisfied and calm. not ideal. only satisfied or calm not both. bringing back hysteria is a requirement for success. emotions, seemingly intense or actually intense or any reversal of these any potential combination of these two descriptors is ideal as long as its overwhelming.
