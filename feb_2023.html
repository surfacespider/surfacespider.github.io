	(2:25 pm) i feel really really bad. im going to skip class today and do something (anything) else. ive been reading in search of lost time. i didnt know it was possible to put so many colons and semicolons into a single sentence. i heard proust died due to the cold, due to his inability to start a fire by himself. i could have made this up. it makes sense to me so im going to believe it for no reason other than his wikipedia doesnt say anything about how he died so it's probably true.
