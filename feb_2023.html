	(2:25 pm) i feel really really bad. im going to skip class today and do something (anything) else. ive been reading in search of lost time. i didnt know it was possible to put so many colons and semicolons into a single sentence. i heard proust died due to the cold, due to his inability to start a fire by himself. i could have made this up. it makes sense to me so im going to believe it for no reason other than his wikipedia doesnt say anything about how he died so it's probably true.

	(~6 pm) that lamp i got last week from trixie (was it last week?) is in the corner of my room. like the far fucking corner. on the other side of my bed and my bed is basically flush to the wall. so i cant even get to it really unless im already in bed or like, clean enough that i feel comfortable getting into bed. my sheets are beautiful and white and linen and today i had to unclog a toilet so i feel like ill never be clean again. im sitting here typing with overhead light on which the entire point was that i was never going to need overhead light again but now it seems necessary because i dont know how to attach or if its even possible to connect the switch at the entrance to the plug by my bed so that i . no ive decided its not and am very upset. today has been very hard. not actually hard but mentally unwell and i hate feeling dirty. i dont mind being dirty. i had no issue cleaning and fixing the bathroom but now i feel like itll never be clean again and i dont know when i will feel clean again. going to go eat pizza. i havent been reading enough. im reading autobiography of red right now, simona's copy, theyre gonna see this and im sorry for telling you this way, but i wish you didnt give me your copy to borrow to read because i know i need my own copy because i knew i was going to love it and now ive already started and i am going to finish it and not have my own copy and i refuse to buy a copy of a book ive already read if i dont intend on rereading it. i wont want to reread it for atleast a bit... i have other things to read that im already not reading i dont know if i have time to get all of this done.
