	(2:25 pm) i feel really really bad. im going to skip class today and do something (anything) else. ive been reading in search of lost time. i didnt know it was possible to put so many colons and semicolons into a single sentence. i heard proust died due to the cold, due to his inability to start a fire by himself. i could have made this up. it makes sense to me so im going to believe it for no reason other than his wikipedia doesnt say anything about how he died so it's probably true.

	(~6 pm) that lamp i got last week from trixie (was it last week?) is in the corner of my room. like the far fucking corner. on the other side of my bed and my bed is basically flush to the wall. so i cant even get to it really unless im already in bed or like, clean enough that i feel comfortable getting into bed. my sheets are beautiful and white and linen and today i had to unclog a toilet so i feel like ill never be clean again. im sitting here typing with overhead light on which the entire point was that i was never going to need overhead light again but now it seems necessary because i dont know how to attach or if its even possible to connect the switch at the entrance to the plug by my bed so that i . no ive decided its not and am very upset. today has been very hard. not actually hard but mentally unwell and i hate feeling dirty. i dont mind being dirty. i had no issue cleaning and fixing the bathroom but now i feel like itll never be clean again and i dont know when i will feel clean again. going to go eat pizza. i havent been reading enough. im reading autobiography of red right now, simona's copy, theyre gonna see this and im sorry for telling you this way, but i wish you didnt give me your copy to borrow to read because i know i need my own copy because i knew i was going to love it and now ive already started and i am going to finish it and not have my own copy and i refuse to buy a copy of a book ive already read if i dont intend on rereading it. i wont want to reread it for atleast a bit... i have other things to read that im already not reading i dont know if i have time to get all of this done.

	(2:14 pm) ive been reading every essay by this person, Leijia Hanrahan. shes why i felt so bad three days ago. im not going to elaborate too much or ill feel even more bad. in her articles and essays she'll link other things and im also reading all of those. im reading one right now called "we are all very anxious" im going to quote something in this. its talking about how in the current mode of capitalism the main affect pushed onto us is boredom and how we are simultaneously more and less connected than ever. "an absurd non-choice between desocialised inclusion and desocialised exclusion." "Precarity differs from misery in that the necessities of life are not simply absent. They are available, but withheld conditionally" the previous affect was misery. for much of the world that is still the dominant mode. for much of the west that is still the dominant mode. i turn 25 in a few months... ill type more of this later... tomorrow maybe... i dont know where im going with this. i didnt know where i even wanted to go when i started... tomorrow...

	if i get into nyu im going to be moving so soon. i only like la in the winter and late fall. only when it seems like its cold and it could rain. as soon as its hot, as soon as the feeling of driving is no longer something easier but something required... moreso than it already is... then i want to pull my hair out. i told narkis that if society collapsed i wouldnt make it because i need to eat a different cultures food every single day. the only thing i can eat every day is nothing. im spoiled. im decadent. a gourmand even. gluttinous and needing (deserving) of so much more than everything ever. what im saying is i currently only have two sachets of english breakfast tea left, and i have no idea what tea to use to replace it. i dont want to buy the same and i refuse to buy any tea that comes with the bags wrapped in plastic. apparently most of the bags are just plastic. tea bags were originially silk and were used to display tea that merchants were selling. some of the customers just dropped the tea filled silk bags into water. i am deserving of drinking tea that has been filtred through silk. i dont know if i am deserving of using anything beyond tap water, but the tea must have touched silk at some point. later, today or tomorrow, i will walk to the expensive grocery store near me, i will buy their housemade apricot jam and a loaf of locally baked sesame sour dough and i will make toast using the jame and some imported french butter that i still have. i will eat this with the last of my plastic covered tea and will probably feel ill.
