	(noon) i have decided to have a second religious/spiritual awakening. i have decided to have it after reading walter benjamins essay/letter On Language as Such and on the Language of Man. i think this is a smart decision. i think this is also the only decision to make. i have decided this because i dont know what else there is to do. or maybe out of boredom or maybe out of excitement. i feel excited. i feel hopeful and im looking forward to... i dont know what in general. i know in particular, but generalities are the experience of life and particularities are the memories (experience) of life. im drinking an excessive amount of caffeine at the moment because i havent done that in a while. the other day i drank black coffee on an empty stomach even though it makes me nauseous because i hadnt felt nauseous in a while. ive never plucked apples from trees, only cherries, only as a child. i followed instructions too well as a child and did not eat the cherries right off the tree. we were charged based on weight and allowed to roam in the orchard picking. if i could pick as many apples as i wanted off a tree i would only pick two; one for now one for later. if i could pick as many cherries as i wanted off a tree i would pick one handful; half for now half for later. the second half will be a little dessert. this essay that made my mouth water and my heart hurt will be my little dessert.
