	15 minutes to my birthday im only going to type until my birthday. twin, twin. megan is my twin. we were born days apart miles apart. twin twin when my light shines it shines for you twin. i hope you see this. i hope you read this. i hope you read everything ive ever said or will say. youre my twin you need this i need this. i like to dedicate my writings to people because i want you to know i felt and lost something in writing this. that i was actually inspired and thought that this was real and inspired. a writer writes but im not really a writer. because i dont write. if i could write i would write of us and every time weve ever laughed. and every time weve struck so close. i dont know what else there is. that's all we are and im okay with that. that's better than most. that's better than all. my twin. my twin. minutes minutes minutes counting. this isnt going well because im not a writer im a rememberer who is always late. i just remembered that i should live near you but i dont. i just remembered that we were supposed to cook dinner together. i just remembered that things were supposed to be so so good. oh no oh well oh oh oh oh god. i think it's fine. i can handle this for now. but if youre far forever then what even is the point?
