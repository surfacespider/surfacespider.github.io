	the omen was the following. on saturday i was in my apartment cooking and cleaning and doing my tasks when a bee flew in my open window and tried to find something it would like. it was very interested in my beer, but i wouldnt let it have it and i shooed it away as it would be dangerous if it actually went into the bottle. i tried to get it to go to my apple cider, but it wasnt interested. i was wearing my sweater which has purple stripes so the bee decided it was interested in that next possibly looking for nectar or whatever. i decided it deserved some sugar water so i moved so slowly to the kitchen and was so gentle in my gathering of sugar and water that the bee stayed on me the entire time. after preparing the bee's feast i guided it over and helped it realized that there was something sweet for it. i watched it drink the sugar water for just a bit and only for just a bit because it quickly lost interest. it flew into the glass of my window trying to get out. it did this a few times over and over before i decided to help it. an open window didnt help. it was lost and stuck and needed my help so i corralled it knowing it wouldnt sting me and helped it out the window. i felt satisfied with my attention directed experience and went back to cooking and cleaning and doing my tasks. about 30 minutes later i took a sip of my beer and almost swallowed a drowned bee. i felt the bee on my tongue and it hit my teeth too.
