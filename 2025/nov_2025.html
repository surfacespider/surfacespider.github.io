	the omen was the following. on saturday i was in my apartment cooking and cleaning and doing my tasks when a bee flew in my open window and tried to find something it would like. it was very interested in my beer, but i wouldnt let it have it and i shooed it away as it would be dangerous if it actually went into the bottle. i tried to get it to go to my apple cider, but it wasnt interested. i was wearing my sweater which has purple stripes so the bee decided it was interested in that next possibly looking for nectar or whatever. i decided it deserved some sugar water so i moved so slowly to the kitchen and was so gentle in my gathering of sugar and water that the bee stayed on me the entire time. after preparing the bee's feast i guided it over and helped it realized that there was something sweet for it. i watched it drink the sugar water for just a bit and only for just a bit because it quickly lost interest. it flew into the glass of my window trying to get out. it did this a few times over and over before i decided to help it. an open window didnt help. it was lost and stuck and needed my help so i corralled it knowing it wouldnt sting me and helped it out the window. i felt satisfied with my attention directed experience and went back to cooking and cleaning and doing my tasks. about 30 minutes later i took a sip of my beer and almost swallowed a drowned bee. i felt the bee on my tongue and it hit my teeth too.

	the other day my dad called me to ask how i was. he asked me if my mom had told me about how chanel had passed. my dad is funny in a way that he refused to call chanel chanel and instead named her war kitty. he also named her daughter battle cat. my dad is very bad at expressing himself or telling things directly or at all but he wanted to tell me himself even though my mom had already told me. the round about way he told me was that war kitty went on a mission and it didnt go well, that she's not returning. he said it slowly in a way that made it hard for me to tell if he had planned on telling me of her passing in this way or if he was going to be direct. his voice wavered as he told me. in my phone saved i have a photo my mom sent me along with the news. shes wrapped in a blanket and in the back seat of the car. i dont know when she took it. i dont know if she had passed when it was taken or if my mom knew she had passed when she took it. when she called me later she asked me something about her eyes in the photo. i didnt really respond. im looking at the photo. her eyes seem the same as always. 

	chanel never sat on you and didnt like to be held. she would sit next to you and if you didnt actually pet her, she would stay for hours. if you stood next to her and reached down she would recoil. i would place my hand in front of her head and she would kind of head but it so she would have complete control of how and where she was being touched. she couldnt really meow it always was so strained and had a delay as if she forgot she was meowing when she opened her mouth and only remembered at the end.
