	<b>lectures on phase transitions and the renormalization group</b> - nigel goledenfeld - i dont think im much smarter than i was before i read this. i mostly skipped over the parts that i didnt know well enough already... <br>
	<b>the fifth wound</b> - aurora mathias - finally finished. isnt it also so lovely isnt it all so upsetting <br>
	<b>notes from underground</b> - dostoevsky - do you feel sick down there? you should <br>
	<b>aliens and anorexia</b> - chris kraus - decades old simone weil autofiction <br>
	<b>2666</b> - roberto bolano - unfortunately it does all hurt and it is all so confusing <br> 
	<b>by night in chile</b> - roberto bolano - i dont think any of us did a very good job or made the right decision. at least some of us understand. <br>
	<b>the melancholy of resistance</b> - László Krasznahorkai - the fall of the ussr was one of the worst things that has ever happened to humanity <br>
