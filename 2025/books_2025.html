	<b>lectures on phase transitions and the renormalization group</b> - nigel goledenfeld - i dont think im much smarter than i was before i read this. i mostly skipped over the parts that i didnt know well enough already... <br>
	<b>the fifth wound</b> - aurora mathias - finally finished. isnt it also so lovely isnt it all so upsetting <br>
