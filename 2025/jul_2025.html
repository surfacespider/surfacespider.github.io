	ive decided this is the most important video ive ever taken. izzy said that she can see me making a pond scum situation out of the trees in my back yard. i dont know what she means. i think its a reference to thoreau. ive never read thoreau. i dont actually know anything about him and think that's fine. ive been doing this with trees in general for years. since i decided to start freaking out and being unwell instead of just being unwell. there's no sound on it because it's a gif. there is definitely a real actual way to upload this as a video with sound that you can click play on and appreciate directly but i dont think my writing should have an explicit aural quality. i also don't want to learn how to do that. if you want to hear it let me know. if you want to hear it tell me and i will send the video to you any way you like. later ill describe how it sounds. much much later.

	(izzy guest spot)
	izzy is an expensive (but not too expensive) hooker. Her problem is she only tolerates her own very specific kind of off-putting person. Her other problem is being honest and just asking for a thousand dollars from one of these people once they've met all her criteria of: not too old, not too fat, not too bald, not too fascist, not too stupid, not diseased, and just not too ugly. She forgets that they're the ones who put themselves in the cesspool and its a favor to them when she narrows them out of it, not the other way around. As if her specificity had anything to do with their character. The last one couldn't keep it up which was confusing. That's like shelling out for a michelin star meal after getting your stomach stapled. He has two Maine Coons. Then she got it: It must be nice to have a paid attendant to make eye contact with you while you rub your flacid cock on her. She felt like a Physical Therapist. She wonders what physical therapists charge to get came on three times. They were on the same team! He also had a barrel chest, which made him look blockier and fatter than he had to, and it's insurmountable, nothing can be done. Good thing his face was pretty okay. He might also have been a pedophile. He'd get harder when she shot up the octave. 

	When did the barrel chest go out of style? Now only sweaty married men have them. They used to be in James Bond, and now if you have a barrel chest you need to pay at least 800 dollars to have sex. Your nipples don't sit right. You're short-waisted, which for a grown man is a situation. No matter how fit you get you'll always look like an elderly extra on M*A*S*H with your blocky pectorals supporting some JOHN DOE prop dogtag. Barrel chested divorcees and hip-dip hostesses finger fucking each other under midtown tables across the universe xoxoxoxo
