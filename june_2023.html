	(8:45 pm) youve got to understand that i am not going to go to barcade the original bar arcade. youve got to understand that im not going to go anywhere where the average clientelle is millenials, first dates, and millenials on first dates. unless its a wine bar. there are two wine bars near me. one i frequent and one i intend on frequenting. only one is gentrifying its area really too which is nice. the gentrifying one is next to the gentrifying coffee shop in a very quiet neighborhood. it's modeled after portuguese wine bars which means its menu is full of sea food and costs 5 times as much as any nearby restaurant. god i cant wait to go. im going to go with megan. and, im not sure if you can believe this, but they both serve natural wine and list the bakery where they get their bread from.

 	(7 am) ive been up for an hour and i dont know what ive been doing. narkis is maybe leaving tomorrow for his drive back to chicago. hes maybe leaving right now for his drive back to chicago. ive been having a lot of issues messaging people back or typing or writing in general. in my head ive switched over to being only contactable by letter but im not but ive been treating all of those other ways of contact as if they were letters. weeks for replies. except faith, faith needs to text me back i wont grovel for a reply... no ill text faith and ill ask her "do you hate me" then spend a very long time describing the caramels im eating right now, how the box cost $16 which comes out to like 80 cents a caramel. they big but theyre not that big. i kind of wish there were more and tehy were smaller to be honest. its like $2.5 per oz. i dont know if thats a good deal, its definitely way more expensive than a lot of things i eat in my life, which is probably a bad thing. i try to only eat organic now because i think its funny and if i eat too much garbage i want to throw up sometimes. the caramel is made with fennel pollen which is probably why its so expensive. it has the most mild anise flavor. i just read their slogan or whatever on the box "explore - enjoy - share - repeat" there is a seafood restaurant that my parents love in florida that i am extremely ambivalent about called the melbourne seafood station: i'll randomly remember their slogan they had up one day and start dry heaving because it was so funny. i dont even remember the entire slogan just two words. more restaurants should be "playful" and "industrious" these caramels are playful. instead of industrious i would use something like "craftful" if that is even a word or "artful" or something else that doesnt actually mean anything. ive had like 6 of these caramels in the past 30 minutes and now my stomach hurts so bad. ciao
